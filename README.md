# A study of forecasts in Financial Time Series using Machine Learning method

### Abstract
Forecasting financial time series is one of the most challenging problems in economics
and business. Markets are highly complex due to non-linear factors in data and uncertainty.
It moves up and down without any pattern. Based on historical univariate close prices
from the S&P 500, SSE, and FTSE 100 indexes, this thesis forecasts future values using two
different approaches: one using a classical method, a Seasonal ARIMA model, and a hybrid
ARIMA-GARCH model, while the other uses an LSTM neural network. Each method is
used to perform at different forecast horizons. Experimental results have proven that the
LSTM and Hybrid ARIMA-GARCH model performs better than the SARIMA model. To
measure the model performance we used the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE).
